The data had given a large list of features , but as we only require mean and standard deviations in the list of features , hence we are removing all other columns . Below is the summary regarding the data ( taken from the source codebook) . Below that I have marked the columns kept or removed . 


The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value     | Retained   

std(): Standard deviation | Retained

mad(): Median absolute deviation | Removed 

max(): Largest value in array| Removed 

min(): Smallest value in array| Removed 

sma(): Signal magnitude area| Removed 

energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. | Removed 

iqr(): Interquartile range | Removed 

entropy(): Signal entropy| Removed 

arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4| Removed 

correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals| Removed 

maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude| Removed 

meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency | Retained

skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal | Removed 

kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal | Removed 

bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.| Removed 

angle(): Angle between to vectors.| Removed 

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean| Retained
tBodyAccMean| Retained
tBodyAccJerkMean| Retained
tBodyGyroMean| Retained
tBodyGyroJerkMean| Retained

Along with these columns ,we have following additional columns

subject : Denotes the subject number 1:30

ActivityNumber : Code for the activity 1:6

ActivityName : Denote the exact activity corrosponding to the activity number
